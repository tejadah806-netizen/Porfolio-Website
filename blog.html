            <h3>🚀 My Journey into Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                Web development started as a curiosity...
                <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
                    Since high school, I began learning HTML & CSS. As I continued my studies at BCC, I expanded into JavaScript and Python. I initially pursued Computer Science but quickly switched to Web Development because I found it far more enjoyable and creatively fulfilling. Every project has taught me something new, and I genuinely enjoy solving problems with a creative approach.

            <p>
                Staying active while being a tech enthusiast can be challenging...
                <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
                    I make time for workouts, enjoy competitive gaming sessions, and always seek new skills. Balance keeps me sharp both mentally and physically.
